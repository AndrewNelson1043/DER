Schedule A-10 applies to single-phase and polyphase alternating-current service (for a description of  these terms, see Section D of Rule 2*).  This schedule is not available to residential or agricultural service for which a residential or agricultural schedule is applicable, except for single-phase and polyphase service in common areas in a multifamily complex (see Common-Area Accounts section). Under Rate Schedule A-10, there is a limit on the demand (the number of kilowatts (kW)) the customer may require from the PG&E system.  If the customer's demand exceeds 499 kW for three consecutive months, the customer's account will be transferred to Schedule E-19 or E-20. Under Rate Schedule A-10, a bundled service customer with a maximum demand of 200 kW or greater for three consecutive months must have an interval data meter that can be read remotely by PG&E and pay the time-of-use (TOU) charges in accordance with the terms and conditions of this rate schedule.",

Under Rate Schedule A-10, a bundled service customer with a maximum demand of 200 kW or greater for three consecutive months must have an interval data meter that can be read remotely by PG&E and pay the time-of-use (TOU) charges in accordance with the terms and conditions of this rate schedule.",

Schedule A-10 applies to single-phase and polyphase alternating-current service (for a description of  these terms, see Section D of Rule 2*).  This schedule is not available to residential or agricultural service for which a residential or agricultural schedule is applicable, except for single-phase and polyphase service in common areas in a multifamily complex (see Common-Area Accounts section). Under Rate Schedule A-10, there is a limit on the demand (the number of kilowatts (kW)) the customer may require from the PG&E system.  If the customer's demand exceeds 499 kW for three consecutive months, the customer's account will be transferred to Schedule E-19 or E-20. Under Rate Schedule A-10, a bundled service customer with a maximum demand of 200 kW or greater for three consecutive months must have an interval data meter that can be read remotely by PG&E and pay the time-of-use (TOU) charges in accordance with the terms and conditions of this rate schedule.",

If a customers maximum demand has failed to exceed 499 kilowatts for 12 consecutive months, PG&E will transfer that customers account to voluntary E-19 service or to a different applicable rate schedule. After\r\nbeing placed on this schedule due to the 200 kW or greater provisions of this schedule, customers who fail to exceed 199 kilowatts for 12 consecutive months may elect to stay on the time-of-use provisions of this schedule or alternate time-of-use rate schedule.",
